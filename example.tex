\begin{preface}
This thesis represents the capstone of my five years combined academic work 
at Kettering University and past work experiences.  My Culminating 
Undergraduate Experience provided the opportunity for me to use the 
knowledge and skillset learned while at Kettering to manage a project 
of this magnitude.

Although this thesis represents the compilation of my own efforts, I would 
like to acknowledge and extend my sincere gratitude to the following persons 
for their valuable time and assistance, for without whom the completion of 
this thesis would not have been possible:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Jim Lahey, for teaching me what happens when you don't go to college.
  \item Marge Simpson, for all the fashion advice.
  \item Leslie Knope, for teaching me what a strong woman could be.
\end{enumerate}
