#KU Thesis - LaTeX

LaTeX class for the four different kinds of Kettering University theses.

* CUE 495-C (Co-op Thesis)
* CUE 495-E (Entrepreneurial Thesis)
* CUE 495-P (Professional Practice Thesis)
* CUE 495-R (Research Thesis)

Most of the ground work for this project was done by [Arthur Shipkowski](http://www.fox-dreams.com/art/) in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He allowed me to upload it to GitHub and update it for the current Kettering University thesis format.

# What is LaTeX?

According to [the LaTeX Project](http://latex-project.org):

> LaTeX is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.

> LaTeX is based on the idea that it is better to leave document design to document designers, and to let authors get on with writing the documents.

> LaTeX is based on *Donald E. Knuth's* TeX typesetting language or certain extensions. LaTeX was first developed in 1985 by *Leslie Lamport*, and is now being maintained and developed by the LaTeX3 Project.
